# Welcome!

## These are the tutorials I've written in R 

### Currently working on:

* `ggplot` tutorial for Twin Cities R Ladies using data on race and gender in biopics from the fivethirtyeight github page!

### Already finished:

* `Leaflet` and `ACS` tutorial on household income in the Twin Cities
* `dplyr` tutorial using DC Capital Bikeshare data 

### Visit [my github](https://github.com/katiejolly/r-tutorials) to view the code! 

I'm working on adding the tutorials themselves to a static webpage, so check back soon for easier access!
