# Setting up our project

I'm a huge fan of nonfiction books and documentaries. I've never loved a lot of the big Hollywood movies, but I do enjoy biopics. I find that they give me a good amount of the nonfiction that I enjoy and the drama that makes a blockbuster hit. But, I often find myself a little disappointed in the breadth of biopics available. Most feature a pretty narrow demographic group: straight, white men. Fivethirtyeight did a nice story on this pattern and published the data they used. So, we are going to use that data to write our own story with ggplot! 

### Packages needed

First, we'll need to install a few packages. The`tidyverse` package includes both `readr` and `ggplot2`, two of the packages we will be using. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


### Data from the web

Fivethirtyeight publishes a lot of the data they use on [github]("https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data")! We're going to use their `biopics` data. Fivethirtyeight data is also available in an R package call `fivethirtyeight` but I learned by using their github repo, so that's the method I prefer. Either way will get you the same data! 

```{r message = FALSE}
# read in the data from github

biopics <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/biopics/biopics.csv")
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# if you want to use the R package

library(fivethirtyeight)

data(biopics)
```

### Structure of the data

```{r}
# I find glimpse to be a more readable version of head/str

glimpse(biopics)
```
